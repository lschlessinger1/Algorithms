# Algorithms
Below are some of the algorithms I have implemented.

## AdaBoost
Implemented using decision stumps learned using information gain as the weak learners

## Auction Algorithm
Implemented the auction algorithm and a general method for encoding assignment problems as linear programs using GLPK

## Bagged Decision Trees
Built bagging decision trees and computing out-of-bag error using matlab’s inbuilt `fitctree` function

## Gradient Descent
Gradient descent with hinge loss, logistic loss, and hinge loss

## Kernel SVM
A kernel SVM solver with a linear, RBF, and polynomial kernel

## Naive Bayes
A Naïve Bayes binary classifier

## Neural Network
A Neural Network (including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent)

## Perceptron
An implementation of the perception learning algorithm
